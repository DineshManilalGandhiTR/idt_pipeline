#idt_pipeline

This is a pipeline for human action recognition based on improved dense trajectory and svm machine learning model. <br /> 
Part of the code is forked from Limin Wang's improved_trajectory with some modification. <br />
Besides, there is another version of IDT, which takes image sequence and optical flow as input.
